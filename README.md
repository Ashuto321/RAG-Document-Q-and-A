🛠️ Project Name: RAG-Document-Q-and-A
🔍 Purpose: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enables intelligent document Q&A by combining retrieval-based search with generative AI models.

🚀 Features
✅ Ingest & Process Documents – Supports PDFs, DOCX, TXT files
✅ Semantic Search – Retrieves relevant context from documents
✅ Generative AI Integration – Uses LLMs like OpenAI, DeepSeek, or Vertex AI
✅ Efficient Querying – Handles natural language questions with context-aware answers
✅ Fast & Scalable – Supports local and cloud-based deployment

🏗️ Architecture Overview
🗂 Document Store → 🔍 Retriever → 🧠 LLM (Generative AI) → 📜 Answer Generation

1️⃣ Ingestion – Upload and preprocess documents
2️⃣ Indexing – Store document chunks using vector embeddings
3️⃣ Retrieval – Fetch relevant passages based on a user’s query
4️⃣ Generation – AI answers the question using retrieved context
5️⃣ Response – Provides accurate, explainable results

🛠️ Installation & Setup
🔹 Prerequisites
Python >=3.8 🐍
OpenAI/DeepSeek API Key 🔑 (if using generative AI)
Dependencies installed via pip
